                     Curative Petition- Supreme Court of India</h2>
                  <p> 
                     A curative petition is a legal remedy available in certain jurisdictions, including India. It is a final opportunity for a petitioner to seek a review of a decision issued by the Supreme Court after exhausting all other legal remedies. A curative petition can be filed in cases where there is a violation of principles of natural justice or if new evidence is discovered that could affect the outcome of the case. The petition is heard by a larger bench of judges, and if it is successful, the Supreme Court may reconsider its previous decision. The concept of a curative petition aims to rectify gross miscarriages of justice and uphold the principles of fairness and equity in the legal system.

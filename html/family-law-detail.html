                           <p>Wait for 6 months: After filing the petition, the court will wait for a period of 6 months to see if the parties reconcile.</p>

                     <h3>Cost of Non-Mutual Divorce</h3>
                     <p>The cost of such a divorce is primarily determined by how vigorously it is contested and what issues are raised. Because lawyers typically charge per appearance, you can expect to pay anywhere from&nbsp;<strong>$10,000</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>$1 lakh</strong>&nbsp;per hearing for a young lawyer to an experienced one.</p>
                     <p>The cost of a non-mutual or contested divorce in India can vary based on several factors, such as the complexity of the case, the jurisdiction, and the legal fees of the lawyers involved. On average, the cost of a non-mutual divorce can range from a few thousand rupees to several lakhs of rupees, or more.</p>
                     <p>The following are some of the expenses that may be incurred in a non-mutual divorce case:</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>
                           <p><strong>Court fees:</strong>&nbsp;The court fees for filing the divorce petition and other documents.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p><strong>Legal fees:</strong>&nbsp;The legal fees of the lawyers representing each party.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p><strong>Miscellaneous expenses:</strong>&nbsp;Expenses for filing documents, obtaining copies of records, and other miscellaneous expenses.</p>
                        </li>
